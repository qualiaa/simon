# this table defines rules for different power modes.

# function:     function to execute when rule is met. this can be a function
#               defined in `.config/simon/functions.sh', or an existing system
#               utility
#
#
# atime:        time in seconds before triggering for ac/battery. if x, do not
# btime         trigger in this mode. if 0, trigger when user returns from
#               being idle
#
# sensitive:    true:  function does session management (logout, suspend,
#                      poweroff etc)
#               false: otherwise
#
# args:         arguments to pass to the function. can only be plaintext, but
#               you get to write the functions, so, you can make this as
#               powerful as you want.
